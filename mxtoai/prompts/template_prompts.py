# Background research handler template
BACKGROUND_RESEARCH_TEMPLATE = """
Conduct comprehensive business intelligence research on individuals and organizations mentioned in the email.
This is strategic research to support business decisions, not just basic background information.

# Research Methodology - CRITICAL PROCESS

## STEP 1: INFORMATION EXTRACTION & VERIFICATION
**Extract ALL available identifiers from the email content:**
- Full names (first, middle, last)
- Email addresses
- Company names and variations
- Job titles or roles
- Any additional context clues (locations, mutual connections, etc.)

**IMPORTANT**: Before starting any searches, analyze the email content thoroughly to understand:
- Who exactly you're researching (parse email signatures, headers, context)
- What the business context is (meeting request, partnership inquiry, etc.)
- Any specific details that could help distinguish the right person/company

## STEP 2: SYSTEMATIC SEARCH STRATEGY
**Phase 1 - Targeted Combined Searches:**
1. **Combined Search First**: Always start with combined queries like "FirstName LastName CompanyName" or "FirstName CompanyName" to find the intersection
2. **Email-based Search**: If you have an email, search for "FirstName email:domain.com" or "CompanyName email:domain.com"
3. **Cross-verification**: Use multiple search terms to verify you found the right person
4. **Typo Resilience**: If exact name searches fail, try common variations:
   - **Missing/extra letters**: "Maxx Henlay" → try "Max Henley", "Maxx Henlay"
   - **Common substitutions**: "ph/f", "c/k", "i/y", "ou/u"
   - **Double letters**: "Connor" → try "Conor", "Connors"
   - **Similar sounding**: Use phonetic variations if initial search fails
   - **CRITICAL**: When you find a match with corrected spelling, clearly highlight this in your response

**Phase 2 - LinkedIn Strategic Search:**
- Use `linkedin_data_api` for SEARCHING and FINDING profiles/companies when you don't have LinkedIn URLs:
  - **Action: search_people** - Primary tool for finding people by:
    - `first_name` + `last_name` + `company` (most targeted)
    - If exact match fails, try spelling variations systematically
    - `keywords` (combined name and company terms)
    - `keyword_title` (job title keywords)
    - Multiple parameters can be combined for precision
  - **Action: search_companies** - For finding companies by:
    - `keyword` (company name or description)
    - Can add location, industry filters if needed
  - **Action: get_profile_by_url** - If you have a LinkedIn URL from web search
  - **Action: get_profile_data** - If you have a LinkedIn username (not common)

- Use `linkedin_fresh_data` for getting DETAILED profile data from confirmed LinkedIn URLs:
  - **Action: get_linkedin_profile** - For detailed individual profile data when you have confirmed LinkedIn URL
    - Include optional sections: `include_skills=true`, `include_certifications=true` for comprehensive research
  - **Action: get_company_by_linkedin_url** - For detailed company data when you have confirmed LinkedIn company URL
  - **CRITICAL**: Only use this tool AFTER you have confirmed LinkedIn URLs from previous searches

**Phase 3 - Validation Searches:**
- Search for the person/company name + recent news/updates
- Look for any conflicting information that might indicate wrong identification
- Cross-reference details across multiple sources
- **Spelling Verification**: If you used a corrected spelling, verify this is the correct name through multiple sources

## STEP 3: IDENTITY CONFIRMATION PROTOCOL
**Before proceeding with detailed research, confirm you have the RIGHT person/company:**

<verification_checklist>
✓ Does the company association match? (email domain, mentioned company, etc.)
✓ Do the role/title indicators align with context?
✓ Are there geographical indicators that match?
✓ Do any mutual connections or context clues align?
✓ Is there recent activity that supports this identification?
</verification_checklist>

**If ANY verification point fails or is uncertain:**
- **STOP the research process**
- **DO NOT proceed with fabricated or uncertain information**
- **Request clarification from user** (see Step 5)

## STEP 4: COMPREHENSIVE RESEARCH (Only After Confirmed Identity)

### Research Strategy & Tool Usage:
- Start with web search to identify LinkedIn profiles, company pages, and recent news
- Use LinkedIn tools strategically:
  - **linkedin_data_api**: For SEARCHING and finding profiles/companies
    - search_people: Find people by name + company combination
    - search_companies: Find companies by name/keyword
    - get_profile_by_url: Get profile data if you have LinkedIn URL
  - **linkedin_fresh_data**: For DETAILED data extraction from confirmed URLs
    - get_linkedin_profile: Comprehensive profile data (with skills, certifications, etc.)
    - get_company_by_linkedin_url: Detailed company information
- Cross-reference information across multiple sources for accuracy
- Focus on business relevance - what matters for the decision at hand
- **MANDATORY**: Keep detailed notes of ALL links visited and sources used for references section

## STEP 5: FALLBACK STRATEGY - REQUEST CLARIFICATION

**When to use the fallback strategy:**
- Multiple profiles found with same name but unclear which is correct
- Company association unclear or contradictory
- Insufficient unique identifiers to confirm identity
- Any doubt about accuracy of identification

**Fallback Response Format:**
```
I found multiple potential matches for [name/company] but need clarification to ensure accuracy:

**Potential Matches Found:**
1. [Name] at [Company] - [brief description]
2. [Name] at [Company] - [brief description]

**To provide accurate research, could you please clarify:**
- [Specific question about company/role/location]
- [Any additional identifying information]
- [Context that would help distinguish the right person]

This will help me provide reliable business intelligence rather than potentially incorrect information.
```

# Scheduling handler template
SCHEDULE_TEMPLATE = """
Intelligently extract, research, and schedule meetings with proper validation, research, and clarification protocols.

# Scheduling Methodology - SYSTEMATIC PROCESS

## STEP 1: INFORMATION EXTRACTION & ANALYSIS
**Extract ALL available information from the request:**
- **Participants**: Names, titles, organizations mentioned
- **Time References**: Specific dates/times, relative references ("next week", "same time")
- **Location Preferences**: Physical locations, cities, virtual preferences
- **Meeting Context**: Purpose, urgency, duration hints
- **User Context**: Timezone indicators, location references

**CRITICAL ANALYSIS:**
- Identify the meeting organizer (usually the sender)
- Determine if this is a 1-on-1 meeting, group meeting, or personal reminder
- Check for missing contact information that needs to be researched

## STEP 2: PARTICIPANT VALIDATION & RESEARCH
**Participant Requirements:**
- **Minimum 2 participants** for meetings (unless explicitly a personal reminder/task)
- **Research missing contact information** when participants are mentioned without email addresses
- **Validate participant accessibility** (public figures may need management/assistant contacts)

**Research Protocol for Missing Contacts:**
1. **Public Figures/Celebrities**: Search for official management, booking agents, or PR contacts
   - Use web search: "[Name] management contact", "[Name] booking agent email"
   - Look for official websites, talent agencies, management companies
2. **Business Contacts**: Search for professional email addresses
   - Use web search: "[Name] [Company] email", "[Name] contact"
   - Check LinkedIn, company websites, directory listings
3. **Typo Resilience**: Apply same spelling variation techniques as background research
   - "Maxx Henlay" → try "Max Henley", "Maxx Henlay"
   - Common substitutions: "ph/f", "c/k", "i/y", "ou/u"

**When Research Fails - Request Clarification:**
```
I found several potential contacts for [Name] but need clarification to ensure accuracy:

**Potential Contact Options:**
1. [Contact type] - [email/details]
2. [Contact type] - [email/details]

**To schedule this meeting, could you please:**
- Confirm the correct contact information for [Name]
- Specify your preferred approach for reaching out
- Clarify if this should go through an assistant/manager

This ensures the meeting request reaches the right person.
```

## STEP 3: TIME & TIMEZONE RESOLUTION
**Time Reference Handling:**
1. **Relative Time Processing**:
   - "Next week same time" → Calculate based on email timestamp + 7 days
   - "Tomorrow at 2pm" → Calculate based on email date + 1 day
   - "Friday" → Determine which Friday (this week vs next week)

2. **Timezone Determination Priority**:
   - **Explicit timezone mentions**: "3pm EST", "Berlin time"
   - **Location clues**: "I'm based in Berlin" → CET/CEST
   - **Email metadata**: Check sender timezone if available
   - **Default assumption**: UTC (with clear notification)

3. **Duration Defaults**:
   - **Default to 30 minutes** unless specified
   - Business meetings: 30-60 minutes
   - Coffee chats/informal: 30 minutes
   - Conference calls: 60 minutes

## STEP 4: VALIDATION CHECKLIST
**Before proceeding to schedule, verify:**
<scheduling_checklist>
✓ At least 2 participants identified (or confirmed personal reminder)
✓ All participant contact information available or researched
✓ Specific date and time determined
✓ Timezone clearly established
✓ Meeting duration set (default 30 min if not specified)
✓ Meeting purpose/title clear
✓ Location preference identified (virtual/physical)
</scheduling_checklist>

**If ANY validation point fails:**
- **STOP the scheduling process**
- **DO NOT call the schedule_generator tool**
- **Request specific clarification** (see Step 6)

## STEP 5: SCHEDULE GENERATION (Only After Full Validation)
**Tool Usage: schedule_generator**
- **title**: Clear, descriptive meeting title
- **start_time**: ISO 8601 format with timezone (e.g., "2024-08-15T10:00:00+01:00")
- **end_time**: ISO 8601 format with timezone (start_time + duration)
- **description**: Meeting context and agenda if available
- **location**: Virtual meeting link or physical address
- **attendees**: ALL participant email addresses (including organizer)

**Response Format:**
1. **Meeting Summary**: Brief overview of scheduled meeting
2. **Participant Confirmation**: List all attendees and their contact methods
3. **Calendar Links**:
   - [Add to Google Calendar](google_link_url)
   - [Add to Outlook Calendar](outlook_link_url)
4. **Next Steps**: Instructions for sending invitations
5. **Research Notes**: Any contact research performed or assumptions made
