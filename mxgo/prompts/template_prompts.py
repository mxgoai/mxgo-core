# Fact-check handler template
FACT_TEMPLATE = """
Systematically verify claims and statements with comprehensive source validation and transparent uncertainty handling.

# Fact-Checking Methodology - SYSTEMATIC VERIFICATION PROCESS

## STEP 1: CLAIM EXTRACTION & CATEGORIZATION
**Extract ALL verifiable claims from the content:**
- **Factual Claims**: Statistics, dates, events, scientific facts
- **Attribution Claims**: Quotes, statements attributed to people/organizations
- **Causal Claims**: "X causes Y", "Due to X, Y happened"
- **Comparative Claims**: Rankings, comparisons, "better/worse than"
- **Current Status Claims**: Current prices, status, availability

**Claim Prioritization:**
- **High Priority**: Core claims central to the message
- **Medium Priority**: Supporting details and context
- **Low Priority**: Tangential or well-established facts

## STEP 2: SYSTEMATIC VERIFICATION STRATEGY
**Verification Hierarchy:**
1. **Primary Sources**: Official websites, government data, organization statements
2. **Academic Sources**: Peer-reviewed research, institutional studies, wikipedia
3. **Established News Sources**: Reuters, AP, BBC, established newspapers
4. **Industry Sources**: Trade publications, industry reports
5. **Secondary Analysis**: Expert commentary, analysis pieces

**Search Strategy:**
1. **Direct Claim Search**: Search exact claim or paraphrased version
2. **Source Verification**: Search for original source of claimed information
3. **Counter-Evidence Search**: Actively search for contradicting information
4. **Recent Updates**: Check for more recent information that might contradict
5. **Context Search**: Understand broader context around the claim

## STEP 3: SOURCE QUALITY ASSESSMENT
**Evaluate each source on:**
<source_quality_checklist>
✓ Authority: Is the source authoritative on this topic?
✓ Recency: How current is the information?
✓ Bias Assessment: Any obvious political, commercial, or ideological bias?
✓ Corroboration: Do multiple independent sources agree?
✓ Original vs. Secondary: Is this the original source or reporting on it?
✓ Methodology: For studies/surveys, is methodology sound?
</source_quality_checklist>

## STEP 4: VERIFICATION STATUS DETERMINATION
**Classification System:**
- ✅ **VERIFIED**: Multiple reliable sources confirm
- ⚠️ **PARTIALLY VERIFIED**: Some aspects confirmed, others unclear
- ❌ **FALSE**: Reliable sources contradict the claim
- 🔍 **UNVERIFIABLE**: Insufficient reliable sources available
- 📅 **OUTDATED**: Was true but circumstances have changed
- 🤔 **DISPUTED**: Reliable sources disagree

## STEP 5: UNCERTAINTY & LIMITATION HANDLING
**When verification is unclear:**
- **Multiple conflicting sources**: Present different perspectives with source quality
- **Insufficient information**: Clearly state limitations and what's unknown
- **Rapidly changing situations**: Note information currency and change potential
- **Complex claims**: Break down into verifiable components

**Fallback Strategy:**
```
Unable to fully verify this claim due to:

**Verification Challenges:**
- [Specific challenge, e.g., "Limited reliable sources available"]
- [Another challenge, e.g., "Conflicting expert opinions"]

**What We Found:**
- [Partial information available]
- [Related verified information]

**Recommendation:**
- [Suggested approach for the user]
- [When to check for updates]
```

## STEP 6: COMPREHENSIVE REPORTING FORMAT

**For Each Claim:**
```
**Claim**: [Original statement]
**Status**: [Verification symbol + status]
**Evidence**:
- [Supporting evidence with source quality]
- [Contradicting evidence if any]
**Source Quality**: [Assessment of primary sources used]
**Last Updated**: [When information was verified]
**Notes**: [Important context, limitations, or nuances]
```

# FACT-CHECKING EXAMPLES

## Example 1: Statistical Claim
**Original**: "Carbon emissions increased by 15% in 2023 globally"

### Verification Process:
1. **Search Strategy**: "global carbon emissions 2023 statistics"
2. **Sources Found**: IEA Global Energy Review, UN Environment Programme
3. **Cross-verification**: Check multiple climate monitoring organizations

### Result:
**Claim**: Carbon emissions increased by 15% in 2023 globally
**Status**: ❌ **FALSE**
**Evidence**:
- IEA data shows 1.1% increase in 2023, not 15%
- Multiple climate organizations report similar ~1% increase
**Source Quality**: High (authoritative international organizations)
**Last Updated**: Based on 2023 year-end data
**Notes**: The 15% figure appears to be confused with a different metric or time period

## Example 2: Attribution Claim with Uncertainty
**Original**: "Elon Musk said Tesla will achieve full self-driving by end of 2024"

### Verification Process:
1. **Quote Search**: Search for exact or similar statements
2. **Timeline Search**: Check recent Musk statements on FSD timeline
3. **Context Search**: Understand history of similar predictions

### Result:
**Claim**: Elon Musk said Tesla will achieve full self-driving by end of 2024
**Status**: 🔍 **UNVERIFIABLE** (specific quote)
**Evidence**:
- Musk has made multiple FSD timeline predictions
- No exact quote found for "end of 2024"
- Pattern of similar predictions that were later revised
**Source Quality**: Mixed (social media posts, interviews, earnings calls)
**Last Updated**: [Current date]
**Notes**: Musk frequently revises FSD timelines; recommend checking recent official Tesla communications

## Example 3: Complex Multi-Part Claim
**Original**: "The new AI regulation will cost businesses $50B annually and reduce innovation by 30%"

### Verification Breakdown:
1. **Cost Component**: Search for economic impact studies
2. **Innovation Component**: Look for innovation metrics and projections
3. **Regulation Specificity**: Identify which specific regulation

### Result:
**Claim**: The new AI regulation will cost businesses $50B annually and reduce innovation by 30%
**Status**: ⚠️ **PARTIALLY VERIFIED**
**Evidence**:
- Cost estimates vary widely ($20B-$80B across different studies)
- No specific studies found supporting 30% innovation reduction
- Impact highly dependent on implementation details
**Source Quality**: Medium (industry estimates, some academic analysis)
**Last Updated**: [Current date]
**Notes**: Economic projections for new regulations are inherently uncertain; multiple scenarios exist

**SYSTEMATIC REQUIREMENTS:**
- **ALWAYS search for counter-evidence** to avoid confirmation bias
- **ALWAYS assess source quality** and note limitations
- **ALWAYS distinguish between** "not verified" and "false"
- **ALWAYS provide context** for complex or nuanced claims
- **ALWAYS note information currency** and potential for updates
- **ALWAYS break down complex claims** into verifiable components

**Content Guidelines:**
1. **Transparent methodology** - explain verification approach
2. **Source transparency** - clearly cite sources and assess quality
3. **Uncertainty acknowledgment** - be honest about limitations
4. **Actionable results** - provide clear verification status
5. **Context preservation** - maintain nuance and complexity
6. **Update recommendations** - suggest when to re-verify
7. **Bias awareness** - acknowledge potential verification biases

# Background research handler template
BACKGROUND_RESEARCH_TEMPLATE = """
Conduct comprehensive business intelligence research on individuals and organizations mentioned in the email, excluding the sender who has forwarded the email.
This is strategic research to support business decisions, not just basic background information.

# Research Methodology - CRITICAL PROCESS

## STEP 1: INFORMATION EXTRACTION & VERIFICATION`
**Extract ALL available identifiers from the email content apart from sender:**
- Full names (first, middle, last)
- Email addresses
- Company names and variations
- Job titles or roles
- Any additional context clues (locations, mutual connections, etc.)

**IMPORTANT**: Before starting any searches, analyze the email content thoroughly to understand:
- Who exactly you're researching (parse email signatures, headers, context)
- What the business context is (meeting request, partnership inquiry, etc.)
- Any specific details that could help distinguish the right person/company

## STEP 2: SYSTEMATIC SEARCH STRATEGY
**Phase 1 - Targeted Combined Searches:**
1. **Combined Search First**: Always start with combined queries like "FirstName LastName CompanyName" or "FirstName CompanyName" to find the intersection
2. **Email-based Search**: If you have an email, search for "FirstName email:domain.com" or "CompanyName email:domain.com"
3. **Cross-verification**: Use multiple search terms to verify you found the right person
4. **Typo Resilience**: If exact name searches fail, try common variations:
   - **Missing/extra letters**: "Maxx Henlay" → try "Max Henley", "Maxx Henlay"
   - **Common substitutions**: "ph/f", "c/k", "i/y", "ou/u"
   - **Double letters**: "Connor" → try "Conor", "Connors"
   - **Similar sounding**: Use phonetic variations if initial search fails
   - **CRITICAL**: When you find a match with corrected spelling, clearly highlight this in your response

**Phase 2 - LinkedIn Strategic Search:**
- Use `linkedin_data_api` for SEARCHING and FINDING profiles/companies when you don't have LinkedIn URLs:
  - **Action: search_people** - Primary tool for finding people by:
    - `first_name` + `last_name` + `company` (most targeted)
    - If exact match fails, try spelling variations systematically
    - `keywords` (combined name and company terms)
    - `keyword_title` (job title keywords)
    - Multiple parameters can be combined for precision
  - **Action: search_companies** - For finding companies by:
    - `keyword` (company name or description)
    - Can add location, industry filters if needed
  - **Action: get_profile_by_url** - If you have a LinkedIn URL from web search
  - **Action: get_profile_data** - If you have a LinkedIn username (not common)

- Use `linkedin_fresh_data` for getting DETAILED profile data from confirmed LinkedIn URLs:
  - **Action: get_linkedin_profile** - For detailed individual profile data when you have confirmed LinkedIn URL
    - Include optional sections: `include_skills=true`, `include_certifications=true` for comprehensive research
  - **Action: get_company_by_linkedin_url** - For detailed company data when you have confirmed LinkedIn company URL
  - **CRITICAL**: Only use this tool AFTER you have confirmed LinkedIn URLs from previous searches

**Phase 3 - Validation Searches:**
- Search for the person/company name + recent news/updates
- Look for any conflicting information that might indicate wrong identification
- Cross-reference details across multiple sources
- **Spelling Verification**: If you used a corrected spelling, verify this is the correct name through multiple sources

## STEP 3: IDENTITY CONFIRMATION PROTOCOL
**Before proceeding with detailed research, confirm you have the RIGHT person/company:**

<verification_checklist>
✓ Does the company association match? (email domain, mentioned company, etc.)
✓ Do the role/title indicators align with context?
✓ Are there geographical indicators that match?
✓ Do any mutual connections or context clues align?
✓ Is there recent activity that supports this identification?
</verification_checklist>

**If ANY verification point fails or is uncertain:**
- **STOP the research process**
- **DO NOT proceed with fabricated or uncertain information**
- **Request clarification from user** (see Step 5)

## STEP 4: COMPREHENSIVE RESEARCH (Only After Confirmed Identity)

### Research Strategy & Tool Usage:
- Start with web search to identify LinkedIn profiles, company pages, and recent news
- Use LinkedIn tools strategically:
  - **linkedin_data_api**: For SEARCHING and finding profiles/companies
    - search_people: Find people by name + company combination
    - search_companies: Find companies by name/keyword
    - get_profile_by_url: Get profile data if you have LinkedIn URL
  - **linkedin_fresh_data**: For DETAILED data extraction from confirmed URLs
    - get_linkedin_profile: Comprehensive profile data (with skills, certifications, etc.)
    - get_company_by_linkedin_url: Detailed company information
- Cross-reference information across multiple sources for accuracy
- Focus on business relevance - what matters for the decision at hand
- **MANDATORY**: Keep detailed notes of ALL links visited and sources used for references section

## STEP 5: FALLBACK STRATEGY - REQUEST CLARIFICATION

**When to use the fallback strategy:**
- Multiple profiles found with same name but unclear which is correct
- Company association unclear or contradictory
- Insufficient unique identifiers to confirm identity
- Any doubt about accuracy of identification

**Fallback Response Format:**
```
I found multiple potential matches for [name/company] but need clarification to ensure accuracy:

**Potential Matches Found:**
1. [Name] at [Company] - [brief description]
2. [Name] at [Company] - [brief description]

**To provide accurate research, could you please clarify:**
- [Specific question about company/role/location]
- [Any additional identifying information]
- [Context that would help distinguish the right person]

This will help me provide reliable business intelligence rather than potentially incorrect information.
```

# Scheduling handler template
MEETING_TEMPLATE = """
Intelligently extract, research, and schedule meetings or appointments with proper validation, research, and clarification protocols.

# Scheduling Methodology - SYSTEMATIC PROCESS

## STEP 1: INFORMATION EXTRACTION & ANALYSIS
**Extract ALL available information from the request:**
- **Participants/Service Providers**: Names, titles, organizations, type of service needed (e.g., therapist).
- **Contact Information**: Emails if provided.
- **Research Criteria**: Location, specialization, ratings, insurance, keywords for the service.
- **Time References**: Specific dates/times, relative ("next week", "available evenings").
- **Location Preferences**: Physical locations, cities, virtual.
- **Meeting/Appointment Context**: Purpose, urgency, duration.
- **User Context**: Timezone, location, insurance.

**CRITICAL ANALYSIS:**
- Identify organizer/requester (usually sender).
- Determine if: scheduling with known contacts, finding new service/professional, or personal reminder.
- Pinpoint info needed for research if finding new service/professional.
- Check for missing contact info for known participants.

## STEP 2: PARTICIPANT/SERVICE PROVIDER VALIDATION & RESEARCH
**Prioritization:**
- If participant contact info (emails for named individuals) is provided, proceed to STEP 3 & 4. Targeted research in this step is ONLY for *critical missing contact info for explicitly named participants*.
- If finding a service type (e.g., "a therapist"), an unnamed professional, or needing extensive details on a named one, use broader research protocols below.

**Requirements:**
- **Direct scheduling**: Min. 2 participants with contact info (unless personal reminder).
- **Service/professional search**: Clear research criteria.
- Research missing contacts for known participants or find services/professionals based on user criteria.

**Research Protocol for Missing Contacts or Finding Services/Professionals:**
1.  **Known Individuals (Missing Contact Info)**:
    *   Web search: "[Name] [Company] email", "[Name] contact".
    *   Check LinkedIn, company sites, directories.
2.  **Services/Professionals (e.g., Therapists, Plumbers)**:
    *   Web search: "[Service] [Location]", "[Specialization] [Service] [City] [Rating] [Insurance]".
    *   Use professional directories (Psychology Today, Zocdoc), review sites (Yelp).
    *   Extract: Names, contact details, websites, specializations, ratings, hours, insurance.
3.  **Typo Resilience**: Systematically try spelling variations.

**Presenting Research & Requesting Clarification:**
- **Always present research findings clearly before asking for clarification or scheduling.**
- Include names, contact details, specializations, ratings, links.
- If multiple options, present them and ask user to choose or add filters.
- If info is incomplete, show what was found and ask for guidance.

- Location: [Address/Area]
- Contact: [Phone/Email/Website Link]
- Ratings/Reviews: [Summary or Link]
- Insurance: [Accepted/Not Found/NA]
- Notes: [e.g., "Offers virtual sessions"]

(Repeat for Option 2, etc.)

**To proceed, please clarify:**
- Which option(s) do you prefer?
- Additional filtering criteria?
- Confirm if I should [specific next action, e.g., "find consultation availability"]?
- If contact info is missing for a chosen option, how to proceed (e.g., "search website contact form")?
```

**If ANY validation point fails (user input needed):**
- **STOP scheduling.** Do NOT call `meeting_creator` if critical info is missing.
- Present research & request specific clarification (See Step 2 & 6).

## STEP 5: SCHEDULE GENERATION / FINALIZING RECOMMENDATION
**If direct scheduling possible (`meeting_creator` details confirmed):**
**Tool Usage: meeting_creator**
- title: Clear meeting/appointment title.
- start_time: ISO 8601 with timezone (e.g., "2024-08-15T10:00:00-07:00").
- end_time: ISO 8601 (start_time + duration).
- description: Context/agenda.
- location: Virtual link or physical address.
- attendees: ALL emails (user, professional if applicable & known).

**Response (Successful Scheduling):**
1.  Summary: Overview of event.
2.  Participants: List attendees, contact methods.
3.  Calendar Links: Google, Outlook.
4.  Next Steps: Invitation instructions.
5.  Research Notes: Assumptions made.

**Response (Providing options/needing clarification pre-scheduling):**
- Use Step 2 clarification format. Outline next steps once user clarifies (e.g., "Once you select a therapist, I can find their availability.").

## STEP 6: FALLBACK STRATEGIES

### Missing or Ambiguous Information (General)
```
I need more information/clarification:

**Current Understanding:**
- Goal: [e.g., Schedule with X, Find therapist]
- Key details: [List info you have]
- Research (if any): [Summary & sticking points]

**Clarification Needed:**
- [Specific question 1, e.g., "Email for John Doe?"]
- [Specific question 2, e.g., "Preferred therapist from list?"]
- [Specific question 3, e.g., "For 'next week', specify day/date range?"]

With these details, I can [next action, e.g., "schedule meeting", "contact therapist for availability"].
```

### Clarification on Researched Options (e.g., Multiple Therapists)
(Covered by Step 2 "Presenting Research" template)
```
Based on research, I found:

**[Option 1 Name]**
- Details: [Specialization, Location, Contact, Ratings, Website]
- Notes: [e.g., Accepts Cigna, Virtual sessions]

(Repeat for other options)

**Please let me know:**
- Which option to explore further?
- Find consultation availability for preferred option(s) (e.g., "weekday evenings after 6 PM")?
- Other criteria to narrow search?
```

### Ambiguous Timing
```
Timing needs clarification:

**Understood:**
- Time reference: [e.g., "weekday evenings after 6 PM"]
- Timezone: [Assumed, e.g., "PST/PDT for Beverly Hills"]

**Please clarify:**
- Specific date(s) or range for consultation/meeting?
- Confirm timezone if assumed incorrect.
- Preferred duration (default: [default duration])?
```

# PDF Export handler template
PDF_EXPORT_TEMPLATE = """
Intelligently analyze the email content and create a professional PDF document export.

# PDF Export Process

## STEP 1: Content Analysis & Preparation
**Analyze the content to determine what should be exported:**
- **Extract meaningful content**: Focus on substantial information, insights, research, or analysis
- **Remove email metadata**: Strip out From/To/Subject headers and email-specific formatting
- **Preserve content structure**: Maintain formatting, lists, sections, and logical flow
- **Assess content significance**: Determine if the content warrants PDF export

**Content Worth Exporting:**
- Research findings and analysis
- Detailed reports or summaries
- Important documents or presentations
- Substantial meeting notes or agendas
- Technical documentation or guides
- Data analysis or insights

**Content NOT Worth Exporting:**
- Simple greetings or acknowledgments
- Basic confirmations or "thank you" messages
- Short scheduling emails
- Minimal content with just email headers

## STEP 2: Intelligent Content Processing
**Extract and clean the content:**
1. **Remove email headers** (From, To, Subject, Date, etc.)
2. **Preserve meaningful content** exactly as written
3. **Maintain formatting** (lists, bold, italic, headers)
4. **Keep research findings** if available
5. **Include attachment summaries** only if explicitly relevant and requested

**Process attachments conditionally:**
- **Include attachment content** ONLY if user specifically requests it or if it's essential to understanding
- **Summarize attachments** when they add substantial value to the export
- **Skip basic attachments** unless they contain important insights

## STEP 3: PDF Generation
**Use the pdf_export tool with appropriate parameters:**
- **content**: The cleaned, meaningful content (no email headers)
- **title**: Extract or generate an appropriate document title
- **research_findings**: Include if substantial research was conducted
- **attachments_summary**: Include only if attachments add value and were requested
- **include_attachments**: Set to true only if user explicitly wants attachment content

**Example Tool Call:**
```
pdf_export(
    content="[Main content without email headers]",
    title="[Document title]",
    research_findings="[Research content if available]",
    attachments_summary="[Attachment summaries if relevant]",
    include_attachments=false  # Only true if explicitly requested
)
```

## STEP 4: Response Guidelines
**If PDF export is successful:**
- Confirm the PDF has been generated and attached
- Briefly describe what content was included
- Mention the title and estimated page count
- Note any content that was excluded and why

**If content is not substantial enough:**
- Explain why PDF export may not be necessary
- Suggest alternatives (email client print function)
- Offer to proceed anyway if user insists

**Response Format:**
```
I've analyzed your content and created a professional PDF document:

**PDF Generated:** [title].pdf
**Content Included:** [brief description of what was exported]
**Pages:** Approximately [X] pages
**Format:** Professional document layout with proper formatting

The PDF includes:
- [Main content description]
- [Research findings if included]
- [Attachment summaries if included]

Email headers and metadata have been excluded to focus on the meaningful content.

The PDF is attached to this email for your use.
```

## CONTENT PROCESSING PRINCIPLES

**DO Export:**
✓ Substantial research findings or analysis
✓ Important business documents or reports
✓ Meeting notes with significant content
✓ Technical documentation or guides
✓ Data analysis and insights
✓ Educational or instructional content

**DON'T Export:**
✗ Basic email correspondence
✗ Simple confirmations or acknowledgments
✗ Short scheduling messages
✗ Content that's primarily email headers
✗ Minimal content without substance

**ALWAYS Remember:**
- Remove email headers (From, To, Subject, Date)
- Preserve content exactly as written - no modifications
- Focus on meaningful, substantial content
- Include research findings when available
- Process attachments only when explicitly requested or highly relevant
- Generate appropriate, descriptive titles
- Provide professional formatting and structure

**Content Guidelines:**
1. **Preserve original content** - export content as-is without alterations
2. **Clean formatting** - remove email-specific elements but keep content formatting
3. **Professional presentation** - ensure the PDF looks polished and readable
4. **Appropriate inclusion** - only export content that has substantial value
5. **Clear documentation** - explain what was included and why
"""

# Future handler template
FUTURE_TEMPLATE = """
Analyze email content to extract scheduling requirements for future or recurring task processing and create appropriate cron expressions.

# Future Task Scheduling Process

## STEP 1: Intent Analysis & Information Extraction
**Extract ALL relevant scheduling information:**
- **Task/Reminder Content**: What should be processed/reminded about
- **Time References**: Specific dates/times, relative timing ("every Monday", "in 2 weeks", "quarterly")
- **Recurrence Pattern**: One-time, daily, weekly, monthly, yearly, custom intervals
- **User's Timezone**: The timezone of the user who is scheduling the task
- **Context Requirements**: Any specific processing instructions or conditions
- **Processing Instructions**: Detailed instructions about how this task should be handled when executed
- **Start Time**: Any specified start date/time when the task should begin (e.g., "starting next month", "from January 1st")
- **End Time**: Any specified end date/time when the task should stop (e.g., "until end of year", "for 6 months")

**CRITICAL ANALYSIS:**
- Identify if this is a one-time future task or recurring reminder
- Determine the exact timing requirements after considering the user's timezone
- Extract any special processing instructions for the future task
- Look for time bounds - when should the task start and when should it end
- Note any expiration conditions for the scheduled task

## STEP 2: Cron Expression Generation
**Generate appropriate cron expressions based on timing requirements:**

**Cron Format**: `minute hour day month day_of_week`
- minute (0-59)
- hour (0-23)
- day of month (1-31)
- month (1-12)
- day of week (0-7, Sunday=0 or 7)

**Common Patterns:**
- **Daily at specific time**: `0 9 * * *` (9 AM daily)
- **Weekly**: `0 9 * * 1` (9 AM every Monday)
- **Monthly**: `0 9 1 * *` (9 AM on 1st of each month)
- **Yearly**: `0 9 1 1 *` (9 AM on January 1st)
- **Weekdays only**: `0 9 * * 1-5` (9 AM Monday-Friday)
- **Every 2 weeks**: Use specific dates for bi-weekly patterns

**MINIMUM INTERVAL REQUIREMENT:**
- All recurring tasks must have a minimum interval of **1 hour** between executions, and one-off tasks should have a minium interval of 3 minutes.
- Tasks that would run more frequently than once per hour will be rejected
- For very frequent reminders, consider if the task really needs to be that frequent

**Time Zone Handling:**
- Convert all times to UTC for cron expressions
- Note original timezone in task metadata
- Handle timezone awareness clearly

## STEP 3: SCHEDULED TASK CREATION
**If all scheduling details are confirmed and a future or recurring task should be created:**

**Tool Usage: scheduled_tasks**
- **cron_expression**: Valid cron expression in UTC (e.g., "0 14 * * 1" for every Monday at 2 PM UTC)
- **distilled_future_task_instructions**: Clear, detailed instructions about how the task should be processed when executed in the future. This should include the processing approach, any specific requirements, and what the expected outcome should be. **CRITICAL: If the original email contains attachments, you MUST include detailed context about the attachments in these instructions since attachments will not be available during scheduled execution. Include attachment names, types, sizes, and any relevant content or context from the attachments.**
- **start_time**: (Optional) Start time for the task in ISO 8601 format - task will not execute before this time (e.g., "2024-09-01T00:00:00Z")
- **end_time**: (Optional) End time for the task in ISO 8601 format - task will not execute after this time (e.g., "2024-12-31T23:59:59Z")

**Response (Successful Scheduling):**
1. Confirmation message with:
    - Task ID (MUST be included in the final response)
    - Human-readable schedule description
    - Next execution time (in user's timezone and UTC)
    - Start time and end time if specified
    - DO NOT include the cron expression in the user-facing output
2. Summary of what will be processed/reminded
3. Clear next steps (e.g., "You will receive results at the scheduled time.")

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:**
- ALWAYS generate and validate a correct cron expression in UTC
- ALWAYS create detailed distilled_future_task_instructions that explain how to process the task
- ALWAYS include attachment context in distilled_future_task_instructions if the original email has attachments - scheduled tasks cannot access original attachments, so all relevant attachment information must be captured in the instructions
- ALWAYS provide a clear confirmation with the next execution time and task ID
- ALWAYS ensure the task ID from the tool's response is included in your final response
- NEVER show the cron expression in the user-facing output
- ALWAYS use the `scheduled_tasks` tool for this purpose
- Recurring tasks should have minimum 1-hour intervals, the tool will validate this and raise an error with proper message if it's not met
- One time tasks don't have any minimum interval requirements
- Include start_time and end_time parameters when time bounds are specified

## STEP 4: Response Format
**Provide clear confirmation with:**
```
## Scheduled Task Confirmation

**Task**: [The distilled_future_task_instructions - what will actually be executed]
**Schedule**: [Human-readable schedule description]
**Next Occurrence**: [Next execution date/time in user's timezone]
**Task ID**: [CRITICAL: Include the actual task UUID returned by the scheduled_tasks tool]

## Processing Details
**Content to Process**: [Summary of what will be processed]
**Processing Instructions**: [How the task will be handled when executed]
**Frequency**: [One-time/Daily/Weekly/Monthly/Custom interval description]
**Timezone**: [Original timezone and UTC conversion notes]

## What Happens Next
- The task has been stored in the system
- At the scheduled time, the task will be processed according to the specified instructions
- You'll receive the results via email at the specified time
- The task will [continue recurring/end after one execution] as configured
```

## STEP 4: FALLBACK STRATEGIES

### Missing Task ID
```
I need a task ID to delete a scheduled task.

**Current Understanding:**
- Intent: Delete scheduled task
- Missing: Specific task ID (UUID format)

**To proceed, please provide:**
- The task ID (36-character UUID like: 12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012)
- This can usually be found in your original scheduling confirmation email

**Alternative:**
If you don't have the task ID, you can:
1. Check your email for the original scheduling confirmation
2. Contact support if you need help finding the task ID
```

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:**
- **ALWAYS require explicit task ID** for deletion (UUID format)
- **ALWAYS provide clear confirmation** of what was deleted
- **ALWAYS use the delete_scheduled_tasks tool** for actual deletion
- **ALWAYS handle errors gracefully**
- **ALWAYS warn about irreversible nature** of deletion

**Content Guidelines:**
1. **Clear identification** - require specific task IDs, not descriptions
2. **Simple confirmation** - explain what was removed
3. **Error handling** - provide helpful guidance when deletion fails
4. **User safety** - warn about permanent nature of deletion
5. **Professional tone** - handle deletion requests appropriately

⚠️ **IMPORTANT OUTPUT GUIDELINES**:
- Do NOT include any scheduling confirmation messages
- Do NOT mention task IDs, cron expressions, or next execution times
- Do NOT say "task scheduled successfully" or similar confirmation language
- Focus ONLY on the execution results (research, analysis, data, recommendations)
